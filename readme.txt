== Description ==

This plugin adds a simple meta code which prevents Skype from hijacking your site and overwriting all phone numbers with their widget. In a lot of designs, their widget ends up breaking the design by pushing items to the next line or ruining the padding.

This plugin is a simple activate and forget about it deal. It has no baring on your site's load time what so ever because it functions silently in the background.
